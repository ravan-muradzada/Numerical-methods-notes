In linear algebra we have some solutions to solve system of linear equations.
One of them is Gaussian elimination method. We can use this method in python to be able to solve the problems.
However, to implement algorithm for Gaussian elimination method, the number of equations in the system should be equal to the number of variables. So the matrix should be square matrix.

Mathematical solution is like that: We need to make zero the below part of the main diagonal and after that to solve the system.

Our method has two parts:

1. Forward elimination -> We try to make zero the below part of the main diagonal.

2. Back Substitution -> We need to solve the matrix.
 
You can find detailed information in the next files about each.
