In Numerical Methods, error refers to the difference between an approximate value and the exact value of a quantity. Errors arise because most real-world problems cannot be solved exactly using numerical methods; instead, we use approximations.

Types of Errors:

1) Absolute error:

The difference between the exact value and the approximat value.

Absolute error = |x(exact) - x(approx)|

2) Relative error:

The ratio of the absolute error to the exact value. It gives a sense of how significant the error is compared to the true value.

Relative error = |x(ex) - x(ap)| / |x(ex)|

3) Truncation error:

Occurs when an infinite process (like a series) is approximated by a finite process. For example, using a limited number of terms in a Taylor series.

4) Round-off error:

Arises due to the limitations of representing numbers on a computer. For instance, the number ùúã (pi) cannot be exactly represented in a finite number of decimal places.



-----------------------------------------------------

Morover, we can divide errors two parts according to other whether the exact value is known or not.

1) True error - It can be computed when the exact value is known.
There are two kinds of true error: 

-Absolute true error: 
E = |exactValue - approximateValue| = Et

-Absolute Percent Relative error:
e = |(exactValue-approximateValue) / exactValue| * 100% = et

2) Estimaded (approximated) error - We do not need exact root to calculate estimated error.
There are also two kinds of estimated error:

-Estimaded Absolute error:
E = |currentEstimate - previousEstimate|

-Estimaded Absolute Percent Relative error:
e = |(currentEstimate - previousEstimate) / currentEstimate| * 100%
