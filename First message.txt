Hello teacher, I hope you are doing well. I am a student from CE 22.2, so you teach us "Numerical Methods". I have a problem with one of your topics. 
So in LMS you have submitted a code for "Gauss elimination with partial pivoting" which does not work properly in some examples. 
The code doesn't work properly when we use this input:

matrix = np.array([[1, 4, 5], [2, 2, 5], [-4, 1, 3]], dtype=float)
right_hand_side = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)

By the way, this is the input example which you gave us in Assignment 5 in LMS.
When we check its answer with the build-in function in Python (from numpy), the results are not the same. The build-in function I have used is this: 

np.linalg.inv(matrix).dot(right_hand_side)

If you pay attention the code and explain why this happens, it will be good because we will have quiz and we need it.
I submitted my own code in this message, please can you look at this and say am I right?
