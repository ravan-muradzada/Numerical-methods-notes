The Secant Method is an open numerical method used to find the root of a function f(x)=0. It is similar to the Newton-Raphson method, but it does not require the calculation of the derivative of the function. Instead, it approximates the derivative using a finite difference between two recent estimates of the root. This makes the Secant Method useful for cases where calculating the derivative is difficult or computationally expensive.

When and Why Do We Use the Secant Method?

-When the derivative is difficult to compute: If the derivative of the function is not readily available or is computationally expensive to calculate, the Secant Method is a good alternative to Newton-Raphson.
-When the function is continuous in the given interval: The Secant Method requires that the function is continuous near the root.
-To avoid calculating derivatives: Unlike Newton-Raphson, it does not require knowledge of the derivative, making it useful for functions where derivative information is unknown.

The formula of the current value is like that:


                     f(x(n)) * (x(n-1) - x(n))
 x(n+1) = x(n)  -   ------------------------------
                      f(x(n-1)) - f(x(n))

Here x(n) means n'th value,
x(n-1) means (n-1)th value
and x(n+1) means (n+1)th value.

Stopping criteria is that:
