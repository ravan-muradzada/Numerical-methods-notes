Diagonally Dominant matrices are specific kind of the matrices. 

If a matrix is diagonally dominant, that means for this matrix in each row this rule is met:

The sum of abs(elements) (except main diagonal element for the current row) should be less than abs(main diagonal element) of this row.

[
    [3, 0, 1],
    [1, 6, 1],
    [1, 2, -5]
]

For the first row:

diagonalElement = abs(3) = 3
sumOfOtherElements = abs(0) + abs(1) = 1

3 >= 1, so it is ok.


For the second row:

diagonalElement = abs(6) = 6
sumOfOtherElements = abs(1) + abs(1) = 2

6 >= 2, it is ok 


For the third row:

diagonalElement = abs(-5) = 5
sumOfOtherElements = abs(1) + abs(2) = 3

5 >= 3, it is ok.
