The Taylor series and Maclaurin series are used to approximate functions using polynomials. These expansions allow us to represent a function as a sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a particular point.


When to Use Taylor and Maclaurin Series

Function Approximation: They can be used to approximate functions that are otherwise difficult to compute. For example, functions like e^x, sin(x), cos(x) can be approximated using their series expansions.
Solving Differential Equations: They can help solve differential equations by approximating the solution function.
Numerical Analysis: Useful for finding roots of equations and performing numerical integration.



Steps for Finding the Taylor/Maclaurin Series Expansion:

Choose the function f(x) you want to approximate.
Select the point a (for Taylor series) or 0 (for Maclaurin series).
Calculate the derivatives of the function up to the desired order.
Evaluate the derivatives at the point a (or 0).
Plug these values into the Taylor or Maclaurin formula to obtain the polynomial expansion.

For Taylor series:

f(x) = sum ( (f^n(a) * (x-a)^n) / n!)
from zero to inf

For Maclaurin series:

f(x) = sum ( (f^n(0) * x^n) / n!)
from zero to inf
