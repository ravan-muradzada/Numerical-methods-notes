Curve fitting is the process of finding a mathematical function (like a line, a curve, or any other shape) that best represents the relationship between a set of data points. It's about drawing a curve or line that best "fits" or matches the data, so we can understand patterns and make predictions.

In the problems we are given some points and wanted to find the best curve formula.


Common Types of Curve Fitting:

-Linear Fit: This is when the data points roughly follow a straight line. y = a*x + b

-Polynomial Fit: If the data follows a curve (not a straight line), we use a polynomial. y = a * x^2 + b * x + c

-Exponential or Logarithmic Fit: Some data grows or decays quickly and these types of data are often best fit by exponential or logarithmic curves. Exponential: y = a * e^(b*x) ; Logarithmic: y = a*ln(x) + b

How to solve? 


In the problem, we are given the type of curve fitting to use, such as linear and polynomial, etc. 
Then based on the type, we write the main equation like (y=ax+b) and then put the given points into it.
At the result, we get some number of equations. We write these equations as augmented matrix and solve it using "Least Squares Method".
