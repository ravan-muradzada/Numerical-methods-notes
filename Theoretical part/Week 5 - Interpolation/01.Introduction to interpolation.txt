In numerical methods, interpolation is a technique used to find an approximate value of a function when the exact value is unknown but nearby data points are available.

It has four most known types:

1. Linear Interpolation 

2. Polynomial Interpolation

3. Spline Interpolation

4. Lagrange Interpolation
