Hello teacher, I hope you are doing well. I have a problem also related to another topic which is "Solving tridiagonal systems". 
You did not give us any code about it, but the mathematical formulas and solution. 
I think, you have made two little mistakes in your formulas.
The both mistakes are in the "Forward Elimination" step.
