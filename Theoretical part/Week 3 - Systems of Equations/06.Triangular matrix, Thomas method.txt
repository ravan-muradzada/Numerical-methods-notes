A Diagonally Dominant Tridiagonal matrix is a special kind of matrix. (For more info, look at 05).

To solve that kind of equations we have special method which is more efficient than standard Gaussian elimination method. That is called Thomas algorithm.

(As you know the elements below the main diagonal in that kind of matrices are called subdiagonal, and the ones above are called superdiagonal.)

In nxn matrix, let's call subdiagonal part "b", superdiagonal part "a" and main diagonal as "m", right handside as "r".
"x" is the answer list.

There are two steps in this algorithm: 

1) Forward Elimination:

Here we need to calculate two things iteratively:

range: [1, n-1]
    m[i] = m[i] - ((b[i] * a[i-1]) / m[i-1])

    r[i] = r[i] - ((b[i] - r[i-1]) / m[i-1])


2) Backward Substitution:

x[n-1] = r[n-1] / m[n-1]

range: [n-2, -1, -1]
    x[i] = (r[i] - a[i] * x[i+1]) / m[i]


----------------------------------

x is our answer list.
