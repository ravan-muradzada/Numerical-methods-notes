Sometimes we are given a system of equations which does not have any exact solution. 
To find approximate solutions for them, we use Least-Squares method.

How does this method work?

We should write the system as augmented matrix. Then we should multiply each side with the tranpose of the given matrix.

After that we can solve the solution using any solution method like Gaussian-Elimination.

Imagine the given matrix is A and we need to find A*x = b.

We should write:

A^T * A * x = A^T * b 

After solving this equation, x is found and it is called "Least squares solution".



Moreover, in the problems these two things can be asked:


1. Least Squares Error Vector:

    it is equal to: b - A * x.

    So after calculatingg x, we can put it here and find "Least Squares Error Vector".


2. Least Squares Error:

    It is equal to magnitute of "Least Squares Error Vector".
    First we should find "Least Squares Error Vector" and then its magnitute.
