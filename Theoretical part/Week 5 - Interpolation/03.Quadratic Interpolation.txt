Quadratic interpolation is a method used to estimate the value of a function at a point 
ùë•
x, using three known data points. Unlike linear interpolation (which fits a straight line through two points), quadratic interpolation fits a second-degree polynomial (a parabola) through three points. This allows it to model curves more accurately.

We use the formula based on: y = a*x^2 + b*x + c.

Imagine we have given x and the points: (x0, f(x0)), (x1, f(x1)) and (x2, f(x2)).

We have a formula to find f(x):

f(x) = b0 + b1 * (x-x0) + b2 * (x-x0)*(x-x1)

Here to find each b:

b0 = f(x0)

b1 = (f(x1) - f(x0)) / (x1 - x0)

b2 = ((f(x2) - f(x1)) - b1) / (x2 - x0)
